apr-util (1.3.4+dfsg-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Ryan Niebur ]
  * move the versioned libmysqlclient15off dependency from libaprutil1
    to libaprutil1-dbd-mysql (Closes: #481976)

  [ Stefan Fritsch ]
  * Add workaround to fix FTBFS when doing parallel build (closes: #527812)

apr-util (1.3.4+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ryan Niebur ]
  * New upstream version
  * add me to Uploaders
  * add repack.sh
  * update to libdb4.7-dev (Closes: #519818)
  * Debian policy 3.8.1
  * remove *.dirs, they're not needed
  * lintian overrides for the symbols file depending on different
    packages, we have those "unusual circumstances" :)
    - debhelper 6 (needed for dh_lintian)
  * remove build/apr_common.m4 in the clean target, it gets modified
    during build and is automatically generated
  * switch the libaprutil1-dbg package to the debug section
  * don't output ldap libs by default from apu-config
  * upload to unstable this time

  [ Stefan Fritsch ]
  * Fix description for libaprutil1-dbg (closes: #508145).
  * Recognize DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck in addition to notest (closes: #515352).
  * Make dpkg-shlibdeps automatically generate the needed dependencies for
    programs that use apr_ldap_init() or apr_dbd_init().
    For dbd, we will genreate an ORed dependency on all libaprutil1-dbd-*
    packages, using libaprutil1-dbd-mysql as default.

  * put the mysql, sqlite3, pgsql, and ldap drivers into their own package.
    (Closes: #481976, #482946)

apr-util (1.2.12+dfsg-8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ryan Niebur ]
  * Upgraded to policy version 3.8.0
    - Reference the copyright in common-licenses instead of including it
    - support for noopt in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
    - Added a README.source
    - added support for parallel in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
  * Dropped the XS- prefix for the Vcs fields in debian/control
  * Made the watch file notice 1.3.x

  [ Stefan Fritsch ]
  * Bump libmysqlclient dependency to 5.0.51a since 5.0.32 from etch has some
    bugs that can make apache2 hang (closes: #490859).
  * Add 'Provides' for the modules that are still included in libaprutil1, but
    will be moved to separate packages with apr-util 1.3.x. This will make
    back-porting packages from lenny+1 to lenny easier.

apr-util (1.2.12+dfsg-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Apply hardening build options independently from apr.

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jun 2008 13:29:48 +0200

apr-util (1.2.12+dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make libaprutil1-dev depend on libmysqlclient15-dev. Libtool needs it for
    linking (really closes: #482270).

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Mon, 26 May 2008 23:45:44 +0200

apr-util (1.2.12+dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't output "-lmysqlclient_r" in "apu-config --ldflags". It is enough if
    libaprutil links to mysql, applications don't need to do it, too.
    (Closes: #482270)

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Sun, 25 May 2008 22:53:36 +0200

apr-util (1.2.12+dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Activate mysql support (closes: #395959). This is made possible by php5
    now linking against the threadsafe version of libmysqlclient. Therefore
    add a conflict with older versions of php5-mysql and with php4-mysql.
  * Rebuild against apr with hardening options: CFLAGS are taken from apr, set
    LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,relro explicitly.
  * Conflict with apache2 << 2.2.8-1, which used an older version of libldap
    and now segfaults with current libaprutil1+libldap.
  * Remove Thom May, Fabio M. Di Nitto, Daniel Stone, and Adam Conrad from the
    uploaders field (thanks for your work).

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Sun, 18 May 2008 17:13:24 +0200

apr-util (1.2.12+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix integer overflow in apr_brigade_partition on 32bit systems.  Urgency
    medium because this made apache segfault when resuming a file larger than
    4GB.
  * Point VCS tags in debian control to trunk, to make them useful with
    debcheckout.

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Feb 2008 20:59:49 +0100

apr-util (1.2.12+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-Depend on libdb4.6-dev instead of libdb-dev >= 4.6, as the latter
    causes problems with sbuild.
  * Change server in watch file since www.eu.apache.org is unreliable.

 -- Stefan Fritsch <sf@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Jan 2008 10:17:09 +0100

apr-util (1.2.7+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix stupid code duplication in apr_md[45].c resulting from C&P.
    Thanks to Peter Samuelson for notifying me.  This makes md[45] work
    correctly.

apr-util (1.2.7+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dependency on libgdbm1 from libaprutil1-dev.
  * Build against libdb 4.4.  Closes: #354510
  * Remove most libs from apu-config --link-ld --libs.  Thanks to Peter
    Samuelson, Closes: #378105
  * Use md4 and md5 implementation from Solar Designer as this is in the
    public domain and not subject to RSA copyright.  This requires a
    repacked source, so add +dfsg to the version number.

  * Fix override disparity.
  * Compile without gdbm.
  * Get rid of all the evil libtool hacks and adjust build-depends

  * Pass --with-berkeley-db to configure so it actually picks up our
    preferred BDB version.

 -- Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Apr 2006 21:59:55 +0200
